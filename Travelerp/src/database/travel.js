// Below you can find an API key to try out Sygic Travel API.
// You can use the key free of charge for up to 1,000 requests per month.
// After you exceed 1,000 requests, we charge €45/month for up to 50,000 requests or €99/month for up to 150,000 requests.
// API key: dpFIM1fBQv9P3S5VFhe7x7MCHNMPbSNx85035HVF
// For example, you can use the following query to get the list of top 100 POIs in New York City:
// https://api.sygictravelapi.com/1.1/en/places/list?parents=city:186&level=poi&limit=100
// Note that the URL does not work in the browser, you need to send a "x-api-key" header along with the HTTP request. We recommend using an API tool (e.g. Postman) to explore the API.
// For each POI there is also a /place-details/ API endpoint, which will return all information for that POI including all contacts, opening hours, full description etc. See
// https://api.sygictravelapi.com/1.1/en/places/poi:11875 for Chrysler Building.
